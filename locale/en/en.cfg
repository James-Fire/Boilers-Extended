[mod-setting-description]
electric-boilers=Whether to make electric boilers. These do not make infinite energy.
fluid-boilers=Whether to make fluid-burning boilers.
thermal-boilers=Whether to make boilers that output heat instead of making steam.
high-pressure-boilers=Whether to make Tier 2 boilers that make 500C steam for Steam Turbines, keeping the 1:2 ratio the T1 have with Steam Engines.
extreme-pressure-boilers=Whether to make Tier 3 boilers, and a T2 Heat exchanger, that make more 500C steam for Steam Turbines. High-Pressure Boilers are made as well.

high-pressure-boilers=High Pressure Boilers
extreme-pressure-boilers=Extreme Pressure Boilers

[technology-description]
high-pressure-boilers=Boilers with a higher working pressure and temperature allows denser power production.
extreme-pressure-boilers=Boilers with an extreme working temperature and pressure maximizes our power production density.
